This PowerShell script is designed to perform package cleanup in Microsoft's System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM). It does this by removing application deployments, applications, and their associated files.

The script begins by importing the ConfigurationManager module, which is required for interacting with SCCM. It then sets the location to 'S01:', which is assumed to be the SCCM server. The script also assumes that the SCCM server is named 'SERVER2' and the SCCM database is named 'CM_S01'.

The script retrieves information about all application deployments in SCCM using the `Get-CMApplicationDeployment` cmdlet. For each application deployment, it retrieves the application name and collection name. 

It then constructs a SQL query to get detailed information about each deployment from the SCCM database. This information includes the computer name, operating system, user name, install date, software status, and more. The SQL query uses several joins to combine data from different tables in the SCCM database. The query also includes a complex conditional statement to determine the status of the application deployment.

The script then executes the SQL query using the `Invoke-Sqlcmd` cmdlet and stores the results. It also filters the results to include only those where the install date is earlier than February 1, 2024.

Next, the script defines a function `GetInfoApplications` to retrieve information about all applications in SCCM. This function uses the `Get-CMApplication` cmdlet to get each application and then parses the application's XML data to get details such as the application name, location, deployment type name, technology, content ID, and size in MB.

The script then calls this function for each application deployment and filters the results to include only those where the application name matches the software name from the SQL query results. The results are stored in the [`$AllApps`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22sccm1.ps1%22%2C%22%24AllApps%22%5D "sccm1.ps1") array.

Finally, the script removes the application deployments, applications, and associated files for each item in the [`$AllApps`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22sccm1.ps1%22%2C%22%24AllApps%22%5D "sccm1.ps1") array. It does this using the `Remove-CMApplicationDeployment`, `Remove-CMApplication`, and `Remove-Item` cmdlets, respectively. The `-Force` parameter is used to suppress confirmation prompts.
